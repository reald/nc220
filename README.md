Some more or less random stuff about TP-Link NC220 IP Camera

# Playing Streams

* Most browsers do not support the live view anymore: "Um, this browser may not support camera video well. Your browser is outdated. 
  Please update to the latest version to play videos."

## Workaround

* You can directly open the mjpeg video stream as URL:
  * Replace "nc220.lan" by your camera ip
  * Replace password string by your password, base64 encoded
  * http://nc220.lan:8080/stream/video/mjpeg?resolution=VGA&Username=admin&Password=YWRtaW4=
  * http://nc220.lan:8080/stream/video/mjpeg?Username=admin&Password=YWRtaW4=
  * Note: Username and Password have to be given inside the url string. The password window seems not to work.


There are a bunch of audio and video sources where you can try to obtain streams from. Most of them do not work as expected but there are some working constellations.

**Playing streams requires authentication!** Use your normal camera user account. **The _password_ must be _base64 encoded_.** In the examples here the standard password _admin_ (YWRtaW4= in base64) is used.
